Introduction:

Built an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze the Airbnb data extracted from MongoDB Atlas. Developed a Streamlit application for trend analysis, pattern recognition, and data insights using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Explored variations in price, location, property type, and seasons through dynamic plots and charts.

Objective:

The objective of this project is to analyze Airbnb data to gain insights into various aspects such as pricing, availability, location, and host characteristics. By exploring the data and visualizing key metrics, the project aims to analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights Analysis.

Technologies and Skills:

• Python • Pandas • MongoDB • PostgreSQL • Streamlit • Plotly • Tableau

Required Libraries :

• Plotly - (To plot and visualize the data) • Pandas - (To Clean and maipulate the data) • Pymongo - (To store and retrieve the data by connecting with MongoDB Atlas) • Streamlit - (To Create Graphical user Interface)

Workflow :

Step 1 : Establish a connection to the MongoDB Atlas database and retrieve the Airbnb dataset.
Step 2 : Clean the Airbnb dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types as necessary. Prepare the dataset for EDA and visualization tasks, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
Step 3 : Develop a streamlit web application that utilizes the geospatial data from the Airbnb dataset to create interactive maps.
Step 4 : Use the cleaned data to analyze and visualize how prices vary across different locations, property types, and seasons. Create dynamic plots and charts that enable users to explore price trends, outliers, and correlations with other variables.
Step 5 : Utilize Tableau to create a comprehensive dashboard that presents key insights from your analysis. Combine different visualizations, such as maps, charts, and tables, to provide a holistic view of the Airbnb dataset and its patterns.

Conclusion:

The project provides a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb data, covering multiple dimensions of interest. By combining data exploration, visualization, and geospatial analysis techniques, valuable insights are derived that can benefit both hosts and guests in making informed decisions related to Airbnb accommodations.
